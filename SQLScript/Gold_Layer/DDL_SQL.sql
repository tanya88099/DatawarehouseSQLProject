DDL Script: Create Gold Views
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script creates **views** for the **Gold layer** in the data warehouse.

    The Gold layer contains **cleaned, conformed, and enriched data** in a 
    **star schema format**, which is used directly by BI tools and dashboards 
    for reporting and analytics.

    The Gold layer includes:
        - Dimension tables: dim_customers, dim_products
        - Fact table: fact_sales

    These views aggregate and join data from the Silver layer and apply:
        - Business rules
        - Surrogate key generation
        - Filtering out irrelevant or historical records
        - Column renaming for readability and standardization

Usage:
    These views should be created after the Silver layer is populated and 
    quality checks are completed. They are read-only analytical layers.
